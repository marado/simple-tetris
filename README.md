Tetris game implementation based on some of the Redux concepts written from scratch in TypeScript. It provides
API that allows you to write your own Tetris application in few minutes.

Playable browser example is available [here](http://rypula.pl/simple-tetris/terminal-game-io-runner-browser.html).

This project uses my other library ([terminal-game-io](https://github.com/robertrypula/terminal-game-io)) as a wrapper
to simplify basic input and output.

It you still want to implement your own Tetris game you can use simple-tetris API. For the details 
please visit example hosted on [CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/l9o0lmm607)

## Installation

```
npm install simple-tetris
```

# TODO

- [DONE] assets to templates
- [DONE] rename terminal-game-io-runner to node and browser
- [DONE] createStore factory that hides reducers
- [DONE] finish rotation database for all tetriminos
- [DONE] project setup based on terminal-game-io wrapper
- [DONE in 1.1.0] split store into matrix and tetrimino sections
- [DONE in 1.1.0] moving the tetrimino by arrows and simple rotations
- detecting collisions both with borders and other blocks (probably in 1.2.x)
- implement hard drop and integrate it with collision detection (probably in 1.3.x)
- move tetrimino one line down after given interval (probably in 1.4.x) 
- when tetrimino will hit the 'ground' trigger new tetrimino (probably in 1.5.x)
- detect and remove completely filled lines (probably in 1.6.x)
- detect game over (probably in 1.7.x)
- more?
- ...   
- extend the readme
- ...
