This package provides API that allows you to easily create clones of the 
Tetris game. It handles game core - your role is to write the UI. Library
was inspired by Redux and was written from scratch in TypeScript.

**NOTE:** This project is still not finished. More details in the TODO section below.

Code example of the simple API client is available on [CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/l9o0lmm607)

Library is shipped with ASCII runner - a simple way of bootstrapping Tetris game without the need of using 
the API. Browser example is available [here](https://cdn.rypula.pl/simple-tetris/v1.1.0/ascii-runner-browser.html).
ASCII runner uses my other library ([terminal-game-io](https://github.com/robertrypula/terminal-game-io)) 
that simplifies basic input and output of the text based games.

## Installation

```
npm install simple-tetris
```

## TODO

- detecting collisions both with borders and other blocks (probably in 1.2.x)
- implement hard drop and integrate it with collision detection (probably in 1.3.x)
- move tetrimino one line down after given interval (probably in 1.4.x) 
- when tetrimino will hit the 'ground' trigger new tetrimino (probably in 1.5.x)
- detect and remove completely filled lines (probably in 1.6.x)
- detect game over / pause game (probably in 1.7.x)
- more?
- ...   
- extend the readme
- ...
